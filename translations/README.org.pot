"** Premise\n"
"   The idea here is to make a system that is\n"
"   1. Simple enough to be pick-up and play.\n"
"   2. Doesn't require special dice.\n"
"   3. Can be learned in an afternoon.\n"
"   4. Is general enough to be used in any setting.\n"
"   5. Is extensible.\n"

"*** Simple Enough to Be Picked up and Played\n"
"    It is important that the system is simple. That anyone can sit down, "
"read the book, and get a somewhat intuitive understanding of how the game is "
"to be played.\n"

"*** No Special Dice\n"
"    For the sake of accessibility, it's important that regular D6 dice are "
"used for the game.\n"
"    If everyone is to pick it up and play it, it's also important that "
"everyone has access to the correct dice.\n"
"    A set of polyhedral, for example, are easy to come by, but are often "
"much more expensive than a set of D6s, as those are often included with most "
"board games.\n"

"*** Can Be Learned in an Afternoon\n"
"    It's important that it doesn't take too long to learn the system, "
"particularly not as a GM.\n"
"    Spending days trudging through rule-books, only to forget half the rules "
"by the end of it is no way to go.\n"

"*** Setting Neutral\n"
"    The system should be usable regardless of the setting and genre of the "
"game played.\n"
"    It should be dynamic enough to fit Noir, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Fantasy, "
"etc.\n"

"*** Extensible\n"
"    Lastly, it should be extensible. \n"
"    Everything in this guide is only meant to be preliminary, if anything "
"needs to be thrown out or replaced, then the player may do so if they "
"wish. \n"
"    Does hacking apply better to the setting than burglary? \n"
"    Then replace one with the other.\n"

"   I don't want to end up with a rulebook 500 pages long by the end of it "
"all, since that defeats the purpose of something learnable in (about) an "
"afternoon.\n"
